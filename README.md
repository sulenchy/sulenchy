### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I am Abudu Abiodun. You can call me sulenchy. I am a software engineer. I'm an employee of Andela who is currently working with snaps. I love building apps, getting things better using code, automation of business processes and making researches.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal Portfolio and MyDiary(A react redux app I built sometime ago. Just discovered that there is a pending bug in the login feature)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and looking forward to build something with `NextJS`.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me more about myself via email at [here](mailto:sulaimanabiodun172@gmail.com@gmail.com?subject=I%20want%20to%20work%20with%20you&body=Please%20tell%20more%20about%20yourself)
